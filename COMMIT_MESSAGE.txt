Fix: Prevent multiple AJAX calls and ensure complete file uploads in CF7 popup

PROBLEM:
- Google Sheets receiving 4-5 duplicate entries per form submission
- Large files (images/PDFs) not completing upload before data sent
- File URLs in Google Sheets were empty or showing thumbnail URLs (13-15KB images)
- Race condition: AJAX calls firing before file upload completion

SOLUTION:
- Added triple-layer duplicate prevention using flags:
  * isSubmitting: Prevents multiple form submissions
  * googleSheetsSent: Prevents multiple Google Sheets AJAX calls
  * _googleSheetsSending: Prevents AJAX call while previous in progress

- Sequential file upload process:
  * Form submission prevented when files detected
  * All files uploaded to WordPress media library first
  * File URLs stored in uploadedFiles object
  * Form submitted only after ALL files complete upload
  * Google Sheets receives pre-uploaded file URLs

- Enhanced file upload handling:
  * Progress tracking (0%...100%)
  * File size validation (max 5MB)
  * 60-second timeout for large files
  * Proper error handling and recovery
  * Support for multiple simultaneous file uploads

KEY IMPROVEMENTS:
✅ Single AJAX call to Google Sheets (was 4-5, now 1)
✅ Complete file upload before data submission
✅ Full-size file URLs in Google Sheets (not thumbnails)
✅ Support for files up to 5MB
✅ Comprehensive console logging for debugging
✅ Clean flag reset between submissions
